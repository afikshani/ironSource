This is the BackEnd infrastructure for “TweetMe”.

It serves the test user configured in the test_account.js file to do some operations using Twitter API.

The following sevices are possible:

1. Tweet a message on behalf of the user account.

2. Get a list of the most recent Tweets of the user.

3. Like a random Tweet from a list of Tweets containing ceratin keyword.

4. Create a new friendship ("follow him") with a follower of ironSource.


****NOTE: IN ORDER TO CHANGE USER YOU NEED TO OPEN AN ACCOUNT, APPLY FOR CREDENTIALS AND WAIT FOR BEING CONFIRMED. ONCE YOU HAVE IT ALL, PUT IT IN THE RELEVANT FIELDS ON test_account.js FILE****

Enjoy!
